<h2>COVID-19 Tracker Tools Project</h2>

This site is public to assist with data analysis tools and scripts on the JHU SSE Covid feed.  We credit Johns Hopkins for their data to make our project possible.  Other data sets may be added at a later time.<br>

The <b>munge</b> directory has python scripts to do data munging and preparations.<br>

The <b>viz</b> directory is where visualization and plotting files are placed.<br>

The <b>data</b> directory is where munge-related output files are placed, as well as reference files.<br>
